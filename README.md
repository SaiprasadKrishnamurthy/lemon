## A Reactive Data Push library built using Vert.x ##

## Quick developer setup ##
* Mount this project in your IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ or NetBeans) as a Maven Project.
* Run ExampleApplication as a standalone java program.
* OPen example.html (as localhost:8765/rsc/example.html) in your browser.
* Hopefully you should be able to see the messages pushed to your browser from the server.

More docs will follow, I'm working on it still.
